# AI-Powered-Autonomous-Driving-System-Using-Deep-Learning-Simulation
Our project pioneers an AI-driven autonomous driving system within AirSim NH, leveraging deep learning for real-time perception, control, and adaptive decision-making. By fusing high-resolution visual data with dynamic telemetry, our model replicates human-like driving behavior with precision, optimizing acceleration, steering, and braking.
